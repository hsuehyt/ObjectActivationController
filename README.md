# ObjectActivationController

**ObjectActivationController** is a Unity script that cycles through a list of GameObjects, activating one at a time for a specified duration before switching to the next. Only one object is active at any given time, forming a continuous loop.

## Features
- üîÑ **Sequential Activation** ‚Äì Cycles through GameObjects in order.
- ‚è≥ **Customizable Durations** ‚Äì Set a unique activation time for each object.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Automatic Looping** ‚Äì Runs continuously, ensuring seamless transitions.
- üéÆ **Easy to Use** ‚Äì Add and manage objects via the Unity Inspector.

## Installation
1. **Clone or Download** the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/hsuehyt/ObjectActivationController.git
   ```
2. Add `ObjectActivationController.cs` to an **empty GameObject** in your Unity scene.
3. In the **Inspector**, add GameObjects to the list and set their activation durations.

## Usage
1. Attach `ObjectActivationController.cs` to an **empty GameObject** in your scene.
2. In the **Inspector**, add GameObjects to the **Activation Slots** list.
3. Assign a **GameObject** to each slot and define its **activation duration**.
4. Press **Play** in Unity to see objects activate in sequence.

### Example
If you add three GameObjects (A, B, C) with an activation duration of **10 seconds** each:
1. **A** is activated for 10 seconds, then deactivated.
2. **B** is activated for 10 seconds, then deactivated.
3. **C** is activated for 10 seconds, then deactivated.
4. The cycle repeats indefinitely.
